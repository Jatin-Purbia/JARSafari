# JARSafari 🚶‍♂️📍

**JARSafari** is a personalized campus navigation app designed specifically for **IIT Jodhpur**. It provides optimized, real-time routes between campus locations like hostels, mess, academic blocks, and more. Unlike general-purpose maps, JARSafari supports **multi-stop navigation**, **live GPS tracking**, **favorites**, and smart autocomplete—all tailored to the student experience.
